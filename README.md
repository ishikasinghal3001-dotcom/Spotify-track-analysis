# Spotify-track-analysis

This project analyzes Spotify song data to understand how different audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and mood (valence) relate to a song’s popularity.

The goal of this project is to explore whether musical characteristics alone can explain why some songs become popular, using data analysis and visualizations.
